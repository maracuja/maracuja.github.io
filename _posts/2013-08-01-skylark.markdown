<p>Skylark is our video content curation system, it sits neatly in front of a lot of industry
OVPs who are very good at creating video transcoding pipelines, but are less interested in
serving the content to the user in a meaningful way on a platform such as Netflix or iPlayer.</p>

<p>Skylark gave us as a company the ability to create bespoke VoD solutions for all sorts of
clients and since we were already VoD specialists as a UX company, suddenly gave us a 
technical USP over our competitors.</p>

<p>At its core it's a django-package that is included into client django projects, providing
a core set of functionality which can then be overriden on a client basis. It provides a
read/write API and connectors to 3rd party services for data ingest and synchronisation with
all sorts of things like eCommerce providers, OVPs and client data sources.</p>

<p>A good demonstration of Skylark's flexibility as a platform are the two live sites built
on top of it. Currently there is <a href="https://player.bfi.org.uk/">BFI Player</a> which is
a front-end built with Django and <a href="https://www.alchemiya.com/">Alchemiya</a> which has
been built using AngularJS.</p>
