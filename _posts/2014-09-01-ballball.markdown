<p>Ballball is NewsCorp's companion to the Sun Goals, feeding in match highlight videos
to multiple regions in South East Asia. It is available as a responsive website and also
an Android app.</p>

<p>The project was very much run as an agile project and immediately after
the release I was responsible for managing the development of new features for the
site and app.</p>

<p>Ballball is developed entirely in django. Within the codebase there is read/write API
serving the data to the site and the app and also ingesting stats and videos from Opta
and Fox Australia respectively.</p>

<p>On a match day, Ballball processes 11k match update transactions
from Opta and 3Gb of data within a space of 3 hours. This includes video
highlights, scores and standings from the top 5 leagues in Europe.</p>
