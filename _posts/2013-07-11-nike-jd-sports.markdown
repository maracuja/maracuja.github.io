<p>This was such a great project for a lot of reasons. It was the 1st time I lead a
team properly (with some absolutely awesome mentoring from the senior tech folks
at R/GA)</p>

<p>we developed a mobile-first responsive website that encouraged teens to
share their favourite trainers out to various social platforms and get rewarded
for it. We were able to use some awesome tech like Redis to track the scoreboards
we were maintaining and it ws one of the first projects in the R/GA London
office to try kanban.</p>
