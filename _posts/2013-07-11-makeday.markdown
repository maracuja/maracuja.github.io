So, we made a talking PingPong table that managed a player waiting list. you texted it when you wanted to play and it picked the next to people in line for a game.

It was completely automated and used more libraries and gadets than I have digits on my hands and feet. Our 3 minute presentation was a list of pronouns which were the names of all the involved technologies.

The ones I can remember are twilio, makeymakey, raspberry pi? (as a server), redis (as a queue), python/fabric and C-C-C-Code Igniter (I think this is the last time I've used Code Igniter).
